# Topological Path Identification in Power Distribution Networks

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a systematic procedure to address the topological path identification (TPI) problem in power distribution networks. The procedure is designed to assist distribution system operators (DSOs) in improving path identification accuracy and adapting to various network configurations.

## Features

- **Raw Information:** Information collected from various sources in power distribution networks not exploitable without transformation.

- **Transformation Functions:** Set of functions to transform raw information into well-defined information.

- **Well-Defined Information:** Information exploitable by an algorithm for path identification.

- **Real Paths:** Current real paths within the distribution network.

- **Hypothetical Paths:** Paths considering initial point knowledge and unknown connections.

- **Active and Backup Paths:** Paths within the distribution network for comprehensive analysis.

- **Hypothetical Paths Compatible with Well-Defined Information:** Utilize an algorithm to determine a subset of hypothetical paths compatible with the transformed, well-defined information.
