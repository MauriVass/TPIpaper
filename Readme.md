# Topological Path Identification in Power Distribution Networks

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a systematic procedure to address the topological path identification (TPI) problem in power distribution networks. The procedure is designed to assist distribution system operators (DSOs) in improving path identification accuracy and adapting to various network configurations.

## Features

- **Raw Information:** Handle raw information collected from various sources in power distribution networks.

- **Transformation Functions:** Implement a set of functions to transform raw information into well-defined information for analysis.

- **Well-Defined Information:** Convert raw data into structured and reliable information suitable for path identification.

- **Real Paths:** Analyze and identify the actual paths within the distribution network based on accurate information.

- **Hypothetical Paths:** Define and generate hypothetical paths considering initial point knowledge and unknown connections.

- **Active and Backup Paths:** Identify both active and backup paths within the distribution network for comprehensive analysis.

- **Hypothetical Paths Compatible with Well-Defined Information:** Utilize an algorithm to determine a subset of hypothetical paths compatible with the transformed, well-defined information.
